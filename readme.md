## Nicolai Weather Map

# The Problem
I want to be able to pull the weather over the span of a week given a specific city. I also want to see what the UV index is that day to adequetly prepare with proper attire and sunblock

# The Solution
I used the Weather API from "OpenWeatherMap.org" to retreive the relevent data and disiplay on my webpage. I was then able to allow user input for the different cities they may be interested in traveling to, and could also save in a local storage to pull from a history as well. 

# Tools
I used the API call from OpenWeatherMap and made the data readable with JS, HTML and CSS.
